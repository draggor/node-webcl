This is an implementation of WebCL (i.e. OpenCL) for node.js.

There is currently no standardized API for OpenCL in JavaScript.  This implementation
is based on the proposed API found at www.khronos.org/webcl/ with minor changes.  This
is a work in progress so some parts of the API are still unimplemented and/or untested.

WebCL for node is developed by Jeff Fifield.  The most current version can be found
at https://github.com/fifield/node-webcl.

If this is useful to you, please consider contributing to development and testing!
